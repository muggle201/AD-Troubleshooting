#### Detects known issues and helps resolve them

xray aims to automate detection of known issues and help resolve them with minimal time and effort.

xray is included with TSS and is run whenever TSS is used for data collection.  
TSS runs xray during data collection to ensure known issues are eliminated before any time is spent on reviewing the data.

#### Usage:

        -DataPath: Path for input/output files
        -Offline: Not running on the actual machine being examined (some -not all- diagnostics can use data files to search for issues)
        -WaitBeforeClose: If any known issues are detected, pauses just before script terminates/window closes
                Use to ensure detected issues are not missed
